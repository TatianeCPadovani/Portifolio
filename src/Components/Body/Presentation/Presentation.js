            I have had the opportunity to study business administration with a focus on human resources management, but <mark className="highlight">technology has always been a strong presence in my life</mark>.

            I have experience working in technology companies, utilizing SCRUM, sprints, and Jira. I am curious and have a natural aptitude for learning new tools.

            Currently, I am studying <mark className="highlight2">front-end development tools</mark> such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React. I consistently dedicate time every day to improve my skills and I find myself fully immersed in these subjects as I truly enjoy programming.

            I have a calm, organized, and helpful personality. I am not hesitant to ask questions or seek help because I strive to understand everything I do thoroughly. I genuinely enjoy assisting others and learning new things, and I am aware that <mark className="highlight3"> my capabilities can expand as much as I am willing to work on them.</mark>
